# Philosophers

Eat, Sleep, Spaghetti, repeat. This project is about learning how threads work by precisely timing a group of philosophers on when to pick up forks and eat spaghetti without dying from hunger.

## Dining philosophers problem

In computer science, the dining philosophers problem is an example problem often used in concurrent algorithm design to illustrate synchronization issues and techniques for resolving them.

## Requirements

- Each philosopher should be a thread.
- One üç¥ per hilosopher.
- To prevent philosophers from duplicating üç¥, you should protect the forks state
with a mutex for each of them.
