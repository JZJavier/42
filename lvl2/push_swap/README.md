## push_swap

This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting.

## Instruction set

For the following instructions, if the instruction is not possible, the part of
it that can't be executed won't.

| Code  | Instruction                         | Action                                                 |
| ----- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `sa`  | swap a                              | swaps the 2 top elements of stack a                    |
| `sb`  | swap b                              | swaps the 2 top elements of stack b                    |
| `ss`  | swap a + swap b                     | both `sa` and `sb`                                     |
| `pa`  | push a                              | moves the top element of stack b at the top of stack a |
| `pb`  | push b                              | moves the top element of stack a at the top of stack b |
| `ra`  | rotate a                            | shifts all elements of stack a from bottom to top      |
| `rb`  | rotate b                            | shifts all elements of stack b from bottom to top      |
| `rr`  | rotate a + rotate b                 | both `ra` and `rb`                                     |
| `rra` | reverse rotate a                    | shifts all elements of stack a from top to bottom      |
| `rrb` | reverse rotate b                    | shifts all elements of stack b from top to bottom      |
| `rrr` | reverse rotate a + reverse rotate b | both `rra` and `rrb`                                   |

## My algorithm
In computer science, radix sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts integers by processing their digits individually. Since integers can represent character strings (e.g. names or dates) and, especially, specially formatted floating-point numbers, radix sort is not limited to integers only.
