# Netpractice

*NetPractice is a general practical exercise to let you discover networking.*

# Important Concepts
## TCP: Transport Layer
TCP, or Transmission Control Protocol, is a fundamental communications standard that ensures reliable data transmission over networks. It establishes connections between devices, breaks data into packets, and guarantees delivery without loss or corruption.

## IP Address: Network Layer
An IP address uniquely identifies a device on a network. It comprises two parts: the host address and the network address. IPv4, the version used in NetPractice, employs a 32-bit address space.

## Subnet Mask
A subnet mask distinguishes network and host portions of an IP address. By applying bitwise AND operations between the IP address and the mask, we determine the network address and available host range.

## Switch
A switch connects devices within a network, efficiently directing data packets to their destinations. Unlike a router, it operates within a single network and cannot communicate across networks.

## Router
A router connects multiple networks, facilitating inter-network communication. Each router interface belongs to a distinct network, preventing IP address overlap.

## Routing Table
The routing table stores routes to different network destinations. It consists of destination addresses and their corresponding next hop routers. Default routes handle packets when no specific route is available.

## IP Addressing and Subnetting
Understanding IP addressing and subnetting is crucial for designing and managing networks effectively. Subnets organize IP addresses into manageable groups, enhancing network efficiency.

## Network Connectivity
For devices to communicate within a network, they must share the same network address. By combining IP addresses and subnet masks, we determine network membership and ensure seamless communication.

## Special IP Ranges
Certain IP address ranges are reserved for specific purposes, such as private networks and loopback addresses. These ranges play vital roles in network configuration and security.

# Conclusion
NetPractice provides a comprehensive exploration of networking fundamentals, from TCP/IP protocols to subnetting and network device functionality. By mastering these concepts, you'll build a solid foundation for designing and troubleshooting networks effectively.
